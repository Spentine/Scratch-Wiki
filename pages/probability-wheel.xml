<h1> Probability Wheel </h1>

<p> A <i>probability wheel</i> is a device or concept that randomly selects outcomes with different probabilities, allocating a higher chance to certain options and lower chances to others. </p>

<p> This script accepts any numerical value for the probability, as long as it does not add to 0 and all numbers are non-negative. </p>

<p> It will normalize the values before choosing a random item. </p>
